<!--Hello digital composer! Welcome to my Elevator Pitch Generator web design tool, powered by Stasis Theory. I'm glad you found it--we're going to adapt a 2,000 year old formula to help you pitch an idea, explaining who you are and what you want, why it's important, and what it will do for your audience. I use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about rhetoric, and a little bit about computer science. Just follow along and with comments like this, and you will make a really cool web documemt that helps pitch your idea and learn a little bit about coding. 

You could make web presentations the easy way by creating a pdf's or powerpoint, or you could do a little more work to better understand these digital tools that you use everyday to (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand our tools and how they work. 

In this file, you will work through the four questions of stasis: conjecture, definition, quality, and policy. This method is tried and true, 100% guaranteed to help you say something meaningful about almost anything. While the Greeks originally used it to help them explore questions and issues, and to try to figure out where others might disagree on those issues, the design can easily be adapted to other ends like this one. You should even commit this exercise of stasis to memory. That way, if you are ever stuck on an elevator with someone important...you'll be ready to have something to say. That was indeed the problem for Archimedes, the engineer who built the first elevator in 236BC and afterwards found himself riding in his elevator with all kinds of powerful people, ascending and descending with nothing to say. And for almost two hundred years, the the problem continued to plague the Greeks until the rhetorician Hermagoras solved this communication problem by developing the questions of stasis. Some say it was actually Aristotle, some hundred years pre-elevator, who first theorized the questions of stasis. And much later in the Roman period, Cicero, Quintillian, and Hermogenes added their own iterations.   

I like to think about stasis theory in terms of space. Some say the goal of this exercise is stasis, or agreement with the other, but I would argue that the goal of stasis is actually movement. Yes, when we come to stasis, we stop. But we stop only long enough in time/space to assess how we got where we are and what happened before moving forward. I argue that we actually use stasis theory to ready ourselves and others to move with changed velocity (in a new direction and perhaps at a different speed.) 
    
To get started with the Elevator Pitch Generator, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file. Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images and pdf's, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our stasis theory web document.
    
If you are working in groups on GitHub, one group member will need to fork the website in GitHub and then each group members should fork from this new repository.

BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--Replace the project title and provide a flashy subtitle. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block." You don't need to do anything in this html. code, but you'll need to change the background image on the style.css page. First replace the el1.jpg with a .jpg or .png in the project folder (hint: simplify the name). Then use your text editor to open your style.css sheet, find the hero image, and replace el1.jpg with the name of your new image-->

<div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Conjecture</h1>
    <h2>Many skiers and snowboarders ride the slopes at Seven Springs every winter, and with that comes a risk of injury. Currently, there is no good way to report an accident other than telling a lift attendant at the top or bottom. A phone application with an accident report form that can immediately notify Ski Patrol of an injury could greatly decrease Ski Patrol response time and potentially increase patient outcome from injury. This way, even people on the chairlift who witness an accident from afar can report an injury.</h2>

<div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Definition</h1>

    <h2>Our app will greet the user with two buttons: one to report an accident, and another to call ski patrol. The accident report form will ask the user for the name of the slope, the location on the slope, and the condition of the victim. The call button will automatically dial the ski patrol number after the user confirms that they want to call. This provides a quick and simple way to contact ski patrol and to get someone the care they need as quickly as possible.

<div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Quality</h1>
     <h2>Not only will this app increase the efficiency of getting ski patrol attention, it will decrease the time an injured skier or snowboarder will be without the medical care needed. Skiing and snowboarding are difficult sports and can be dangerous, especially for starters. Whether people fall the wrong way or run into someone else on the slope, injuries happen and increasing the efficiency of medical care benefits these riders. The current method of finding help on the slopes works, but improving this method allows for quicker medical care for skiiers and snowboarders.

<div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Policy</h1>
    
    <h2>We plan to create this app to be the easiest source of medical care for injuried skiers and snowboarders at Seven Springs. This app will be easy to use and include basic buttons, text boxes, and drop down menus with descriptions. This allows for the quickest contacting of ski patrol. As technology continues to become more prominent, more skiers and snowboarders carry their devices with them when riding, so an app on these devices is the most efficient method of contacting ski patrol.
