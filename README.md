## History

## Intentions
This application intends to help first responders at Seven Springs render aid more quickly and efficiently than the current system.  A user making a report via the app will get useful information to ski patrol more quickly than waiting to get off of the lift or to the bottom of the slope. This can ultimately save lives when serious accidents occur.
